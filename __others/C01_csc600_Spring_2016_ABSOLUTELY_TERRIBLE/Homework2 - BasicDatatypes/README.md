# CSC600
The goal of this homework is to perform experiments with basic data types and to show limitations of basic arithmetic operations. The benefit of this homework is to systematically identify problems related to limited size of various data formats of integers and real numbers, and to learn how to avoid such problems in your programs. In addition, we are interested in popular library functions and basic nonnumeric data formats.

# Write a C++ main program that has the following 10 short independent segments.

1. Show that for unsigned int a,b and a>0, b>0, we can get a+b < a
2. Show that for int a,b and a>0, b>0, we can get a+b < 0
3. Show that for int a,b and a<0, b<0, we can get a+b > 0
4. Show that for double x and x>0 we can get 1. + x = = 1.
5. Show that for double a,b,c in some cases (a+b)+c != (c+b)+a
6. Show the results of the following power function:
pow(-2., 3), pow(-2., 3.0) , pow(-2., 3.00000000001)
7. Show the memory size of the following constants 1. , 1.F, 1 , '1' , and "1"
8. Display 1./3. using 20 digits and show the correct and incorrect digits
9. Display all printable characters of the ASCII table in 3 columns:
first column: 32-63, second column: 64-95, third column: 96-127. Each column must include the 
numeric value and the corresponding character. Following is an example ofone of 32 rows in the ASCII table
33 ! 65 A 97 a
10. Compute sqrt(2.) using your own program for square root function.
